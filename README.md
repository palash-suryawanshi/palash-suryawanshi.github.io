I personally like this book because it gives in-depth information about the importance of statistics in the journey of data science. One of my mentors says that without proper knowledge of statistics, no one can become a good data scientist. The book teaches in-depth about Unix, Git, and data pipelining. The language used in the book is Python. The most important part of this book is Classic Regression Models, in which the author has explained linear regression and logistic regression. This book will definitely help peers to learn and gain in-depth knowledge about data science.
