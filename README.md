Why I personally like this book is because it gives in-depth information about the importance of Statistics in the journey of Data Science. One of my mentors say that without proper knowledge of Statistics no one can become a good Data scientist. The book teaches in-depth about Unix, Git, Data pipelining. The language used in the book is Python. The most important part of this book is Classic Regression Models in which the author has explained Linear Regression, Logistic Regression. This book will definitely help peers to learn and gain in-depth knowledge about Data Science.
